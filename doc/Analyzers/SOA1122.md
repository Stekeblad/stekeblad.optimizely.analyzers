# SOA1122

## Use 'EPiServer.Configuration.Settings.Instance' instead of 'DataFactory.GetSettingsFromContent'

This will generate a warning:

```C#
public EPiServer.Configuration.Settings GetSettingsFromContent_SOA1122(ContentReference content, bool fallBackToStartpage = true)
{
	return DataFactory.Instance.GetSettingsFromContent(content, fallBackToStartpage);
}
```

This does the same thing wihout a warning:

```C#
public EPiServer.Configuration.Settings GetSettingsFromContent_SOA1122()
{
	return EPiServer.Configuration.Settings.Instance;
}
```

## History

Looking at the summary of
`DataFactory.Instance.GetSettingsFromContent(ContentReference)`
it says the following:

> Gets the (Enterprise) settings for a content item.

"Enterprise" features is not something we see often in recent versions.

Investigating DataFactory in CMS 11.13 results with a refererence to
`EPiServer.Core.IEnterpriseSettings` that is marked obsolete with the
following message:

>No longer used, now application is multitenant meaning same Settings is used for all sites

Seems like multi-site installations worked differently in earlier versions,
let's look for when it changed. Looking at a project with CMS 8.11 the
behavior is the same but the obsolete attribute is not present on `IEnterpriseSettings`

Looking further back uncovered Episerver enterprise configuration guides for
[CMS 5](https://world.optimizely.com/documentation/Items/Tech-Notes/EPiServer-CMS-5/EPiServer-CMS-5-R2-SP2/Configuration-in-EPiServer-CMS-5/)
and [CMS 6](https://world.optimizely.com/documentation/Items/Tech-Notes/EPiServer-CMS-6/EPiServer-CMS-60/Enterprise---Configuration/)
as well as a [blog post about setting up multi-site in CMS 5](https://world.optimizely.com/Blogs/Joe-Bianco/Dates/2009/12/Setting-Up-Multiple-Sites-in-EPiServer-CMS-5-Enterprise/)

To summarize what can be seen on these pages:
It looks like in CMS 5 and 6 that you had a separate license per site
(now you have one lincense allowing a certain number of sites),
all sites required their own site in IIS Manager pointing to the same website folder
and all sites add their own section in web.config.

The last point is probably whats relevant in the case of `GetSettingsFromContent`.
Earlier, sites could have different Episerver-related settings set in their section of web.config
and `GetSettingsFromContent` was used for figuring out what site a page belonged to
and get the settings for that site.

Sites are now more closely connected and these settings can no longer be set per-site,
making the method obsolete.
