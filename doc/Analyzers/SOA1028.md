# SOA1028

## Block type is cast to IContent

This diagnostic is reported when a variable of type `BlockData` (or a type derived from it)
is forcefully cast to `IContent`. `As` and `is` casts are not reported.

You should be careful when trying to cast instances of block types to `IContent` because
`BlockData` does not implement that interface in source and is only dynamically added to
<u>**some**</u> blocks at runtime.

Shared blocks (accessible in the assets pane) can be cast to `IContent`. Property blocks
(blocks that are used as a property on another content type)
and inline blocks (block instances only existing inside an `ContentAreaItem`) can not.

You should think about if you really need to cast the block to `IContent` and if that
is the case use a safer way of casting and checking the result.

## Example

This analyzer will report on the following code

```C#
public int GetBlockId(BlockData block)
{
	var content = (IContent)block; // SOA1028
	return content.ContentLink.ID;
}
```

If you need to cast, rewriting to one of the following examples will get rid of the warning:
```C#
public int GetBlockId(BlockData block)
{
	var content = block as IContent;
	return content?.ContentLink.ID ?? -1;
}
```

or

```C#
public int GetBlockId(BlockData block)
{
	if (block is IContent content)
		return content.ContentLink.ID;
	return -1;
}
```
