## Inherit from ScheduledJobBase

Scheduled jobs should (but is not required to) inherit from ScheduledJobBase.

If you do not want the features from the base class you can instead choose to
implement the interface IScheduledJob, this analyzer will see that as valid
implementation and not complain.

## History

ScheduledJobBase was added in CMS 9, in CMS 8 and earlier you inherited from JobBase
that today inherits from ScheduledJobBase, is marked as obsolete and generates a warning.
When upgrading, change from JobBase to ScheduledJobBase.

To support even older versions it's actually supported to have a scheduled job that does
not inherit from a base class nor implements any interface and only have the
ScheduledPlugInAttribute. While possible, you should not create a job like that if
you can avoid it. You will also miss out of many built-in features if you do.
