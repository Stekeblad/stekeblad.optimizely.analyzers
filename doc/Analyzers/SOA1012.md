# SOA1012

## Multiple scheduled jobs must not share GUID

Two or more scheduled jobs can not have the same GUID assigned to them, they must be unique for Optimizely to be able to tell them apart. See documentation for SOA1008 example of benefits and important details surrounding the GUID.

This analyzer only considers usages of `ScheduledPluginAttribute`, not all GUIDs in general.
