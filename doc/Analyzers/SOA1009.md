# SOA1009

## Multiple content types must not share GUID

Two or more content types can not have the same GUID assigned to them,
they must be unique for Optimizely to be able to tell them apart.
Ignoring this error will result in Optimizely throwing an exception when the site starts.
See documentation for SOA1002 example of benefits and important details surrounding the GUID.

This analyzer only considers usages of `ContentTypeAttribute` and usages of
attributes inheriting from it, not all GUIDs in general.

This analyzer can only identify content type GUIDs in source code,
it can't report if a GUID is used both in your code and in a nuget package
or other external code (e.g. one of your pages shares the guid with a epiforms element block).
In these cases you have to wait until you start the site next time for Optimizely to tell you about it.
