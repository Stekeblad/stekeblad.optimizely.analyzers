# SOA1137

## 'DataFactory.ResolveContentFolder' is no longer supported

This will generate a warning:

```C#
public ContentReference ResolveContentFolder_SOA1137(int contentFolderId)
{
	return DataFactory.Instance.ResolveContentFolder(contentFolderId);
}
```

This does the same thing wihout a warning:

```C#
public ContentReference ResolveContentFolder_SOA1137(int contentFolderId)
{
	return ContentReference.EmptyReference;
}
```

[Dedicated content assets folder](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/content-cloud/v12.0.0-content-cloud/docs/content-assets-and-folders)
for a specific content instance can probably be used similar to how
ResolveContentFolder was used:

```C#
public ContentAssetFolder GetContentAssetsFolder_SOA1137(ContentReference content)
{
	var contentAssetHelper = ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstance<ContentAssetHelper>();
	return contentAssetHelper.GetOrCreateAssetFolder(content);
}
```

## Note

`ResolveContentFolder` seems to be traces of a feature that can be tracked
back to CMS 4 and 5 called
[Unified File System](https://world.optimizely.com/Documentation/Items/Tech-Notes/EPiServer-CMS-4/EPiServer-462/Unified-File-System/).

The method immediately returns an empty ContentReference in CMS 10 and 11,
in a version of CMS 8 it seems to return empty content references for
content owned by the default content provider but allowed
[custom content providers](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/content-cloud/v12.0.0-content-cloud/docs/content-providers)
to return what they want.

This type of content folders was probably faced out when blocks
was added in CMS 7.

In current versions of Optimizely you would use the assets folder
"For this page" or "For this block" for similar purposes, see the last code
snippet above for how to find them in code.
