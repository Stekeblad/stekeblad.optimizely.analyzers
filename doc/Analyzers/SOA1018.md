## Cast UrlBuilder to string instead of calling ToString method

In the remarks section of the
[documentation on EPiServer.UrlBuilder.ToString()](https://world.optimizely.com/csclasslibraries/cms/EPiServer.UrlBuilder?version=12#EPiServer_UrlBuilder_ToString)
it reads:

> Do NOT use this method except for debug and human readable output.
To get the properly escaped string, cast to a string with (string).

In the example below you can see how the results differs between
calling `ToString()` and doing a `(string)` cast.

## Example

```C#
var urlB = new EPiServer.UrlBuilder("https://example.com/");
urlB.QueryCollection.Add("test", "test&something=else");
var url1 = urlB.ToString(); // https://example.com/?test=test&something=else
var url2 = (string)urlB; // https://example.com/?test=test%26something%3delse
```

Notice when casting that forbidden and special characters gets percent-encoded
(& gets replaced by %26 and = by %3d).
Failing to escape these characters could lead to unwanted behaviour like
additional query parameters getting injected like above.
