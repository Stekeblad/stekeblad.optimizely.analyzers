## Convert to full Optimizely property

The suggestion from this silent analyzer can expand properties
in Optimizely content types from being auto-properties to
calling into the underlying property collection.

A common use case for this is to implement fallbacks like
always retrieve the page name if the Heading property on a page is not set.

## Example

Before code fix
```C#
public class NewsPage : PageData
{
	public virtual string Heading { get; set; }
}
```

After placing the cursor on "Heading" and applying the fix:
```C#
public class NewsPage : PageData
{
	public virual string Heading
	{
		get
		{
			var heading = this.GetPropertyValue(p => p.Heading);
			return heading;
		}

		set
		{
			this.SetPropertyValue(p => p.Heading, value);
		}
	}
}
```

From here you can then implement the behavior you want, like a fallback to the page name
```C#
get
{
	var heading = this.GetPropertyValue(p => p.Heading);
	if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(heading))
		return PageName;
	return heading;
}
```

## Remarks

The CMS UI does not execute the getter or setter. That means following the example above
will not result in all empty heading properties suddenly showing the page name in the editor interface,
nor will trimming or cleaning logic implemented in the setter be performed on editor actions.

The code will, however, be executed when the property is accessed in code like when
reading from it to render its value in a view or writing to it from an import job.
